<p>ZAP is a great tool for getting into web application security. It's easy to get started and there is plenty of guidance from seasoned ZAP users.</p>

<p><i>"ZAP is the best option for people getting into web security"</i></p>
<p>Matt Tesauro
Product Security Engineering Lead 
Rackspace</p>

  <p>ZAP is a <b>free open source tool</b> designed to allow anybody to find vulnerabilities and improve the security of web applications.</p>

  <p>ZAP is <b>fully documented</b> to help you get started and running automated tests in minutes. As well as comprehensive helpfiles within ZAP, you will find a hive of activity within the ZAP groups and online forums. **A vibrant ZAP community** ensures that there is always help with any question you may have.</p>

  <p>ZAP is a <b>great learning tool</b> that will grow with you as your skills increase. Guidance and step-by-step tutorials can be found free on the ZAP website as well as elsewhere on the web. If reading is not your thing - there is a wide range of ZAP videos - including tutorials freely available on YouTube and elsewhere. One great way to learn ZAP is using it alongside a vulnerable application such as OWASP's WebGoat.</p>
