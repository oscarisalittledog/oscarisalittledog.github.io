ZAP is a great tool for getting into web application security. It's easy to get started and there is plenty of guidance from seasoned ZAP users.

  * ZAP is a **free open source tool** designed to allow anybody to find vulnerabilities and improve the security of web applications.

  * ZAP is **fully documented** to help you get started and running automated tests in minutes. As well as comprehensive helpfiles within ZAP, you will find a hive of activity within the ZAP groups and online forums. **A vibrant ZAP community** ensures that there is always help with any question you may have. 

  * ZAP is a **great learning tool** that will grow with you as your skills increase. Guidance and step-by-step tutorials can be found free on the ZAP website as well as elsewhere on the web. If reading is not your thing - there is a wide range of ZAP videos - including tutorials freely available on YouTube and elsewhere. One great way to learn ZAP is using it alongside a vulnerable application such as OWASP's WebGoat.
