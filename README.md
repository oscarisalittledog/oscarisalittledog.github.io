# I am New to Testing

Making application security accessible and actionable is a key part of OWASP's mission. If you are new to testing then ZAP has you very much in mind.

# I am a Developer or QA Tester

**Most web sites are vulnerable, most of the time** _(White Hat Security Report 2017)_ yet security is typically considered late in the development process if at all. Without fixing these vulnerabilities, the potential exists for hackers to steal critical business data or personally identifiable information, deface a company web site, conduct a denial of service attack, penetrate a companyâ€™s internal network and much more.

# I am a Security Expert or Pen Tester

If you are a Security Expert, ZAP is a powerful addition to your Penetration Testing toolkit. It offers a **massive range of features** to help you analyse a system for weaknesses, flaws or vulnerabilities.
